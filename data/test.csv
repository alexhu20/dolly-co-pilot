Integration Service does not load for the Production Tenant but loads for the Development Tenant.,"The customer experienced an issue with their Integration Service in their Production tenant. It failed to load due to a failure in URL redirection from /login to /main, which was not an issue in the Development tenant. This was observed across all browsers and users within the same Cloud Organization. The support engineer and developers noted that the 'connectorbuilder', 'provisioning', and 'elements' services were enabled for the Development tenant, but not for the Production tenant. The team identified two issues from the HAR file and transaction data: (1) The Connection Service returned a 404 error for this account profile, indicating it could not find this tenant, and (2) a request related to the 'elements' service returned a 404 error because this service was disabled for the Production tenant. The developers performed a data correction for the Production tenant, enabling the missing services ('connectorbuilder', 'provisioning', and 'elements'). After this correction, the Connection Service was no longer returning a 404 error, and the URL redirection issue was resolved. Relevant ticket: https://uipath.atlassian.net/browse/SRE-122845","{ ""text"": [""(1) The Connection Service returned a 404 error for this account profile, indicating it could not find this tenant, and (2) a request related to the 'elements' service returned a 404 error because this service was disabled for the Production tenant""], ""answer_start"": [564, 684]}"
